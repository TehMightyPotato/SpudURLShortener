A no bullshit url-shortener.

## Description

This is the source code for [~~spud.mightypotato.de~~](https://spud.mightypotato.de)(offline). 
I wanted to build a web project that I could host on my shared webhosting plan.

This is not going to be developed further. It's just a silly project that I did because I wanted to.

## Usage

Copy everything to your webservers public directory.

Needs `dblogin.php` with your database login credentials. Specifically `dbhost`, `dbuser`, `dbname` & `dbpass`.
